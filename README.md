## How to submit

1. Create a folder with a random 4 digit number and push your files to it.  

2. Make sure you don't have any PIIs (Personally identifiable information) in the content becuase we need to make sure the judges don't know the owner of the implemtation when they're evaluating. We will make sure to anonymise your commits too. 

3. Fill this Google Form.
